# ALX Backend Javascript README 

## 0x00-ES6_basic

This folder contains the basic concepts and features of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It covers the fundamental topics of the ES6 specification, which introduced several new syntax and language improvements to JavaScript.

Key topics covered in this folder include:

1. **Arrow Functions**: Learn about the concise syntax and lexical scoping of arrow functions, which provide a more compact and convenient way to write functions.

2. **Let and Const**: Understand the differences between `let` and `const` declarations compared to the traditional `var` keyword, and how they affect variable scoping and immutability.

3. **Template Literals**: Explore the concept of template literals, which allow for easy string interpolation and multiline strings, using backticks (\`).

4. **Destructuring**: Discover how to destructure arrays and objects to extract specific values and assign them to variables easily.

5. **Default Parameters**: Learn how to define default values for function parameters, simplifying the handling of missing or undefined values.

6. **Rest Parameters**: Understand the rest parameter syntax (`...`) and how it enables functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

7. **Spread Operator**: Explore the spread operator (`...`) and its various applications, such as spreading array elements into function arguments or combining arrays.

8. **Classes**: Get familiar with the new class syntax in ES6, which provides a more concise and familiar way to define objects and their behavior in JavaScript.

## 0x01-ES6_promise

This folder focuses on the ES6 Promise API, which introduced a standardized way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises simplify the management of asynchronous code, making it more readable and maintainable.

Key topics covered in this folder include:

1. **Introduction to Promises**: Understand the basics of promises, including their purpose, structure, and how they differ from traditional callback-based asynchronous patterns.

2. **Promise States**: Learn about the three states of a promise: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. Understand how promises transition between these states based on asynchronous operations.

3. **Promise Chaining**: Explore how to chain promises together using the `.then()` method, allowing for sequential execution and the handling of multiple asynchronous operations.

4. **Promise Error Handling**: Discover how to handle errors in promises using the `.catch()` method and how to propagate errors through promise chains.

5. **Promise Composition**: Learn advanced promise handling techniques, such as Promise.all(), Promise.race(), and Promise.allSettled(), for handling multiple promises simultaneously.

6. **Async/Await**: Dive into the ES8 feature of async/await, which provides a more synchronous-style syntax for handling promises, making asynchronous code even more readable and intuitive.

## 0x02-ES6_classes

This folder focuses on the ES6 class syntax, which introduced a more structured and object-oriented approach to JavaScript. Classes allow developers to define blueprints for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

Key topics covered in this folder include:

1. **Class Definitions**: Understand the syntax for defining classes in ES6, including constructors, instance methods, and static methods.

2. **Inheritance**: Explore how to create class hierarchies using inheritance, allowing for code reuse and specialization of behavior.

3. **Getters and Setters**: Learn about the use of getters and setters to define computed properties and control the access and modification of class members.

4. **Private Class Members**: Discover how to define private class members using the `#` syntax, ensuring encapsulation and preventing direct access from outside the class.

5. **Class Expressions**: Explore the concept of class expressions, which provide a way to define classes as anonymous expressions or dynamically at runtime.

6

. **Class Modules**: Learn how to export and import classes using the ES6 module syntax, enabling modular development and code organization.
